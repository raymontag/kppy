Install:
--------

Just type "python setup.py install" (or "python3 setup.py install") with root
rights in the root directory of kppy.

WARNING:
--------

As long as the database is opened with this
module, the password is saved as plain text in RAM. Even if
the database was closed correctly it is possible that the password lies
somewhere in your computer's RAM, it's not possible to prevent this in Python.
That is, if your computer is compromised it is possible to dump the password
from memory. To prevent some scenarios you could change the working directory of
Python to /var/empty on UNIX-like systems while using kppy. Are core dump wouldn't
 be possible unless you're using kppy as root.
